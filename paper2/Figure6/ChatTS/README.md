# ChatTS

Welcome to ChatTS! Click here to access the [web application](https://singlecellgpt.com/chatTSP?password=chatTS)

Here are some tips to get you started:

1. To use this application, you'll need an OpenAI API key. To get one, create an OpenAI account and go [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to create an API key.
   - Becuase we currently use only gpt-4o, you'll need to purchase $5 or more of OpenAI credits.
   - Note: To get an API key, you don't have to write any code or install any software.
4. Enter your OpenAI API key in the provided field (your API key is not saved on the server after you end your session).
5. Ask your question about the donor's heath condition, demographics, and social history, etc.
6. Select the answer style: "Data Retriever" for simple answers like 'yes', 'no', or a number; "Chart Review" for more detailed answers and supporting information.
7. Click "Submit" to get your answer.
8. Use the "Reset" button to clear the answer table content.
9. Click "Download Answer" to download the answer as a csv file.
10. Click the GitHub icon to visit our repo for ChatTS's usage demo and feel free to report bugs, issues, or feature requests.

To ensure high-quality answers, we use gpt-4o from OpenAI for all requests. If you are seeing errors about your api quota, visit the [OpenAI API usage tier documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-one) for more information about the rate limits.
