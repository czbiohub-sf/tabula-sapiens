## Generating unannotated dataset

## Label Propagation
Each organ expert group had used cellxgene to annotate celltypes from a cellxgene object. 
We read in the csv output by cellxgene (this required a little bit of manual engineering because the column names and numbers are not the same) 
We convert all the non-standard terms to cell ontology standard cell types, except for terms that we deem necessary to be added to the ontology. 
There are unlabelled cells after manual annotation (Smartseq2 cells, or cells with missing expression that cannot be annotated confidently) and all those cells are labelled using the scanvi algorithm.
